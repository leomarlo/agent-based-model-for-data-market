# a agent-based simmulation for crowdsourcing acquisition of data in a decentralized network

# First we define the agents with abilities

We have the following abilities:

- upload data
- annotate data
- verify data


#then we define the environment

#then we define the simulation

#then we run the simulation

#then we plot the results

#then we save the results
